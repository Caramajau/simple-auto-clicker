## Want a simple auto clicker?

Then here it is!

Choose a location with your mouse and just press ```g``` (or multiple times for multiple locations), then ```j``` and it will start clicking there. To stop press ```k```, and if you want new positions clear it with ```c``` and record new ones with ```g``` again. Lastly exit the program using ```ESC```. 

For more advanced usages there is the ability to stop recording positions by toggling the recording mode on or off using ```r```. It is even possible to custom the controls and how fast the clicking is done by changing the values in the JSON file. Also, don't worry about breaking the contents in the file, it will either ignore it or reset to default if anything happens.
