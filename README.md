## Want a simple auto clicker?

Then here it is!

Choose a location with your mouse and press ```g``` (or multiple times for multiple locations), then ```j``` and it will start clicking there. To stop the clicking, press ```k```. If you want new positions clear it with ```c``` and record new ones with ```g``` again. Lastly, exit the program using ```ESC```.

For more advanced usages there is the ability to stop recording positions by toggling the recording mode on or off using ```r```. It is also possible to customise the controls and click speed by changing the values in the ```options.json``` file. Lastly, don't worry about breaking the contents in the JSON file, the program will either ignore it or reset the file to default if anything happens.
